# Travelling Salesman Problem with Drone

This repository is meant for publishing some of our code related to the travelling salesman problem with drone, or TSP-D.

Currently, only a core module is shared, that can be used to read and write instances, solutions and images of the problem.
In the future we aim to publish more modules with actual solvers. There is also some code that can be used to generate instances,
and an example solver that provides random solutions.

In case you use this software for research purposes, it is appreciated if you provide a citation of the following paper:

N.A.H. Agatz, P.C. Bouman & M.E. Schmidt. Optimization Approaches for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone. Transportation Science.

The paper still has to appear, but was accepted for publication. This notice will be updated with a more detailed reference if that information is available.

Instances used during our research can be found in a seperate repository: https://github.com/pcbouman-eur/TSP-D-Instances
